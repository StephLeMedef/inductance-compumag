Parametric and free-shape air gap optimization of an inductor using [NGSolve](https://www.ngsolve.org/) and [Mmg](http://www.mmgtools.org/).

## Quickstart

Start by running the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder. 

## Contents

- dependencies
    - mmg
      - `mmg2d.dll` : dll file related to remeshing free-shapes with Mmg
- notebooks
    - `FREEFORM.ipynb`, `PARAMETRIC.ipynb`, `REFERENCE.ipynb`, `TAYLOR-TESTS.ipynb` : runable Jupyter notebooks
    - `mmglib.py` : binder to Mmg utilities
    - `shapeOptInductance.py` : module containing useful functions for shape optimization
- `AUTHORS `
- `LICENSE`
- `Pipfile` : description of the environment (items can be installed with `pip`)
- `README.md`

**NB** The code has been tested with success on Windows 11. It should also run on Linux except for the free-form due to the compilation of Mmg library.
